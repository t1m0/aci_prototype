# Paparazi Problem with randomly movig security guard
This is a simulation of a paparazi, who wants to take pictures of a celebrity.
To increase the complexity, we also introduced randomly moving security guard.

This transfers the previously static problem to a dynamic one.

The paparazi has to find the optimal way multiple times (using an A* algorithm),
to evade the movign security guards, until he reaches the celebrity.

Sample visualizations of the simulation can be found in the "Visualization" folder.
