# Paparazzi Problem with randomly movig security guard
This is a simulation of a paparazzi, who wants to take pictures of a celebrity.
To increase the complexity of the traditional paparazzi, we also introduced randomly moving security guards.

This transfers the previously static problem to a dynamic one.

The paparazzi has to find the optimal way multiple times (using an A* algorithm),
to evade the movign security guards, until he reaches the celebrity.

Sample visualizations of the simulation can be found in the "Visualization" folder.

## How To Run
The simulation itself is written in python and can be found in the folder "Application".
For easy postprozessing and visualization of the results, the simulation is executed with jupyter notebooks.

The runtime of the full simulation is above 9 hours!
